# Data Collection and Analysis
### Reliable Resource
Kaggle is a very useful platform. Many projects would provide complete and clean dataset, which saves a lot of searching time. Alternatively, academic papers often list the source of the data in the reference section. However, in most of time, we are not fortunate enough to find this sort of dataset. 

How to address this? 
**CHATGPT** Press the button of online search and he will quickly produce candidate values and relevant reference. **BUT BE CAREFUL DO NOT USE THEM DIRECTLY**, in some cases, AI assistant would have illusion when lack of resource. What we should do is to open the link referred by the large language model and verify the validation of data. If the model requires many real-world parameters, we should have a part called data calibration in report. This section confirms the chosen values are reasonable and consistent with common sense. Alternatively, values should be marked with bracts like [1] in the text and properly cited in the reference section with their source.



An individual bee performing 10 flights per day with an average flight duration of 0.1 days is consistent with typical foraging behavior under good conditions. Hive population $N = 60,000$ reflects a strong colony during peak blossom season. Parameters such as $h = 0.4$, $p = 0.35$, and $f = 20%$ are plausible assumptions for survival, reproduction, and fertilization rates. The calibrated value of $k = 4.17 × 10^{-5}$, derived from the number of hives and resource availability, allows the model to produce realistic estimates of hive requirements for various crops. Overall, these values provide a reasonable foundation for the model while acknowledging that variation exists due to environmental and seasonal factors.
